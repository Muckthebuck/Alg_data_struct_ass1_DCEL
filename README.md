# Algorith and data structure: Assignment 1 - DCEL implementation in c

Problem Context:

The context of the assignment task is that a set of watchtowers have been provided for the citizens of Victoria to protect against bushfires, funding has been allocated based on a number of regions and the government wants to better understand the total population the watchtowers in each region are watching over.

Task:

In this assignment, you will create a fundamental data structure which supports the sorting of points of interest into partitions of a geometric space. These data come from properties of Victorian postcodes and a simple initial polygon. A user will be able to provide modifications to this polygon and receive information about what points land in each location.
